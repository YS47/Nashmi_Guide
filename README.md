## Models Explanation

### `PlaceModel` (abstract)
The base class for any place in the app. Defines shared fields: `id`, `name`, `city`, `imageUrl`, `assetImage`. Declares the abstract method `getDisplayInfo()` which subclasses must implement.

### `DestinationModel` (extends PlaceModel)
The main model. Adds `category`, `shortDescription`, `fullDescription`, `ticketPrice`, `bestTimeToVisit`, `activities` (List), `tips` (List), `mapsUrl`, and `isFeatured`. Overrides `getDisplayInfo()` to return a formatted summary string.

### `CategoryModel`
Stores category data: `id`, `name`, `icon` (IconData), `description`, and `color`.

---

## Controller / Helper Classes

### `DestinationController`
The main data layer. Stores a private list of all 9 Jordan destinations. Provides:
- `getAllDestinations()` — returns all destinations
- `getFeaturedDestinations()` — returns only featured ones (shown on home)
- `getDestinationsByCategory(String category)` — filters by category
- `searchDestinations(String query)` — searches by name, city, or category
- `getAllCategories()` — returns all category objects

### `FavoriteController`
Manages the favourites list:
- `addFavorite(destination)` — adds if not already saved
- `removeFavorite(id)` — removes by ID
- `isFavorite(id)` — returns true/false
- `getFavorites()` — returns the full favourites list
- `toggleFavorite(destination)` — convenience method

---

## ListView.builder Usage

`ListView.builder` is used in **DestinationsScreen** to display the filtered list of destinations. It only builds widgets that are visible on screen, making it memory-efficient for large lists.

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: destinations.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return DestinationCard(
      destination: destinations[index],
      onTap: () => Navigator.push(...),
    );
  },
)
```

---

## Navigation and Data Passing

The app uses `Navigator.push` with `MaterialPageRoute` to navigate from the list screen to the details screen. The selected `DestinationModel` object is passed directly as a constructor parameter:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (_) => DestinationDetailsScreen(
      destination: destinations[index],   // object passed here
      favoriteController: favoriteController,
    ),
  ),
);
```

The details screen receives the full object and displays all its fields without any additional data fetching.

---

## Search and Filter

**Search** is implemented using a `TextField` in `DestinationsScreen`. As the user types, `setState` is called with the updated query. The controller's `searchDestinations()` method checks if the name, city, category, or short description contains the query string (case-insensitive).

**Category filter** uses horizontal `ListView.builder` with custom `CategoryChip` widgets. Selecting a chip calls `getDestinationsByCategory()` on the controller. Searching clears the active category filter and vice versa.

---

## OOP Concepts

### Abstraction
`PlaceModel` is an abstract class — it defines the structure for all place types but cannot be instantiated directly. It forces subclasses to implement `getDisplayInfo()`.

### Inheritance
`DestinationModel extends PlaceModel` — it inherits the base fields and adds destination-specific ones like `category`, `ticketPrice`, `activities`, etc.

### Encapsulation
Destination data is stored in private (`_destinations`) lists inside the controller. External code accesses data only through public methods (`getAllDestinations()`, `searchDestinations()`, etc.), never directly.

### Polymorphism
The `getDisplayInfo()` method is declared abstract in `PlaceModel` and overridden in `DestinationModel` to return `'$name | $city | $category | $ticketPrice'`. Different subclasses could return different formats.
